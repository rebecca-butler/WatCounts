# WatCounts
WatCounts is a COVID-19 occupancy tracking application designed for the University of Waterloo. It uses a computer vision object tracking and detection algorithm to monitor the number of people entering and exiting a room. This information is recorded on a web app so students can plan their trips to the university and avoid areas of high occupancy.

The system is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a Camera Module.
